# Bui CSS
A contemporary, approachable css library for prototyping and beyond

## Quick start

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ndchristie/bui` and run the following command: `npm run build`
- Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com): `npm install bui-css`

Both methods will yield the following folder structure, containing compiled and minified css:
```
bui-css/
└── lib/
    └── css/
        ├── bui.css
        ├── bui.css.map
        ├── bui.min.css
        └── bui.min.css.map
```

## Features

### Semantic classnames, Descriptive Mixins

Bui is built on Sass, 

### Accessibility First

All of the pairings found in Bui's classes and mixins meet the requirements for [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) level AA or higher for normal text.

Bui also helps users with common types of colorblindness.  By shifting the classic green-red split towards teal and orange, these users are better able to distinguish actions at a glance, improving confidence and reducing mistakes, without sacrificing information or aesthetics for non-colorblind users.
